# EDA Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Indian IPOs.

## Project Overview
Here I have analysis the various aspect of Indian IPOs from 2010 to 2023.
Some key findings are 
1.2021 has highest number of IPO and it also surpassed the other years in account of total issue size. Which is quite surprising because of pandemic scenario in 2021. I think COVID-19 has pushed more and more companies for IPO.
2.Out of 358 company 200 company make profit which is 55.87% profit. Which is higher percentage of profit than investing ways. So if you add some research in IPOs with this profit percentage(55.87%) that will also increase. So investing in IPOs has more chance of profit than loss.
3.Total Subscription>=50 has a high chance of positive listing gains.
